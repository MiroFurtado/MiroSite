  <p>I'm a student studying Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/applied-mathematics">Harvard University</a> with a focus in Physics. I am particularly interested in statistical learning and its application to scientific computing.</p>
  
  <p>I am a member of the <a href="http://hoffman.physics.harvard.edu/">Hoffman group</a>, a lab studying the nanoscale properties of exotic materials. At the Hoffman lab, I work on designing recipes for the etching of atomically smooth $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ and explore genetic algorithms' use in fitting simulated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_reflectivity">X-ray reflectivity</a> curves.</p>

  <p> In my spare time, I’m an avid <s style="text-decoration: line-through;">car dodger</s> cyclist who ocasionally contributes articles on global affairs to the Harvard Political Review and loves to follow the latest nonsense coming out of my hometown of DC.</p>
