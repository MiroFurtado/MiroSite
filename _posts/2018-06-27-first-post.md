This is my first post in what will become my notebook. I intend to post details about any projects I'm working on, political thought, and all around general musings. To do so, I've added a couple of features to the site. 

First off, we can see that there is built-in code formatting:

{% highlight python %}
from people import miro

me = miro.new_miro()

me.write_cheesy_blog_post(include_meta_referential_humor=True)

# Wow I'm even PEP8 compliant!
{% endhighlight %}

I've also included some built-in LaTex formatting with MathJax, so if you were ever wondering what the integral of the normal pdf was over its domain, here you are!

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(x) \ dx = 1$$

The integral of a probability distribution over its domain is 1! Who would have guessed?

Anyways, this marks the end of my first notebook and (hopefully) the beginning of more to come!
