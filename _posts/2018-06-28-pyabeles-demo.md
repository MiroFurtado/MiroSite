I just released an , a library for X-ray reflectivity curve simulation and fitting of experimental data using differential evolution (an evolutionary algorithm for global optimization). What follows is a brief demonstration of how it works and an application to some data measured by a researcher at the Hoffman lab.

PyAbeles can easily be installed using, although you should already have the Anaconda scientific computing environment installed. 

The fundamental object
